# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /docs/adr for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Database schema changes

## Tech Stack
-   Typescript is the primary language for this project.
-   We are using bun as a replacement for node.js
-   Project is based on NextJs and use React along with TailwindCss.
-   Shadcn UI library is used for adding UI Components. Avoid building your own UI components unless shadcn ui doesn't provide it.
-   This is how you add shadcn ui component: `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add button` by running this in terminal.

## Code Style & Patterns
-   Prefer composition over inheritance
-   Use repository pattern for data access

## Testing Standards

-   Unit tests required for business logic
-   Integration tests for API endpoints
-   E2E tests for critical user flows

# Security

## Sensitive Files

DO NOT read or modify:

-   .env files
-   Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

## Security Practices

-   Never commit sensitive files
-   Use environment variables for secrets
-   Keep credentials out of logs and output
